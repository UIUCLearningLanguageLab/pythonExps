Welcome! In this experiment, you will see read words on the screen and make keyboard responses. On each trial, you will first see a fixation cross: +, then see two words in quick succession. Your job is to press the "1" if you think this is a word, and the "2" key if it is not a word. Press the space bar to continue.
We want to to make this decision as quickly and as accurately as you can. Place your left hand so your fingers are resting on the 1 and 2 keys, so you can make these responses as quickly as you can. PRESS THE SPACE BAR TO CONTINUE
